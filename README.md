# Parallel Epsilon

The aim of this project was to add concurrency support to Epsilon. The source code can now be found in the [main Epsilon repository](https://git.eclipse.org/c/epsilon/org.eclipse.epsilon.git/).
This repository currently hosts resources for evaluating performance, for convenience and reproducibility of experiments.
For up-to-date runnable JAR files, please see [this shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P9wt2jv_iue5s43T2G8LI7XKW0W4zb3l). For sample models used in benchmarks, please see [this shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xEIRyDwbPkrG5fqBTedVsLYsi4avGNIU). Alterantively, if the site is still working, they were originally sourced from [here](http://atenea.lcc.uma.es/projects/LinTra.html).

Benchmarks can automatically be generated from evaluation_superscript.py (see the cmd/sh files for example invocation). This is provided as a highly convenient and simple way to reproduce benchmarks without having to manually configure command-line arguments each time.
