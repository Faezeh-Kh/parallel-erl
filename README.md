# Parallel Epsilon

The aim of this project is to add concurrency support to Epsilon. The source code can now be found in the [main Epsilon repository](https://git.eclipse.org/c/epsilon/org.eclipse.epsilon.git/). This repository is currently used for experimental works not yet integrated into Epsilon.
Additional files and resources are also hosted here for convenience and reproducibility of experiments. For up-to-date runnable JAR files, please see [this shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P9wt2jv_iue5s43T2G8LI7XKW0W4zb3l). For sample models used in benchmarks, please see [this shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xEIRyDwbPkrG5fqBTedVsLYsi4avGNIU).
